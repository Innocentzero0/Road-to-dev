## Overview

This repository documents my ongoing learning journey in both C++ and Python. As UnsignedCoder, I delve into the fundamentals of these programming languages, utilizing Visual Studio 2019 for C++ development and Jupyter Notebook for Python projects. To build a strong foundation in C++, I am following the textbook "Fundamentals of C++ Programming" by Richard L. Halterman, which serves as an invaluable resource. Simultaneously, I am exploring various Python learning materials to complement my understanding.

## Learning Resources

In addition to the textbook, I have been enriching my knowledge through video tutorials from two prominent YouTube channels: **The Cherno** and **Caleb Curry** for C++, and **Corey Schafer** for Python.

### C++ Learning Resources:

1. **The Cherno**: Although this channel may not be the ideal starting point for complete beginners, its in-depth explanations and advanced topics are particularly beneficial as I progress in my C++ understanding.

### Python Learning Resources:

1. **Corey Schafer**: Corey's tutorials cover a wide range of Python topics, from the basics to more advanced concepts. His clear explanations and practical examples make Python learning enjoyable.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into different branches, each representing a distinct stage of my learning journey in both C++ and Python. The branches are labeled accordingly to facilitate easy identification. Within these branches, you'll find structured code files and projects related to the chapters and concepts I'm studying from the C++ textbook and Python tutorials.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in exploring my progress and code samples, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:UnsignedCoder/Road-to-dev.git
   ```
   or for HTTPS
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/UnsignedCoder/Road-to-dev.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the specific branch that corresponds to the chapter or topic you want to explore:

   ```
   git checkout master
   ```

4. For C++ projects, use Visual Studio 2019 (or any compatible C++ IDE) to open the project files and code samples. For Python projects, you can use Jupyter Notebook to explore the notebooks.

## Contribution

As I continue my learning journey in both C++ and Python, I welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from the community. If you notice any errors, offer improvements, or wish to discuss specific concepts in either language, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!
