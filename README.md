## Overview

This repository documents my ongoing learning journey in C++ using Visual Studio 2019 as my primary development environment. As I progress through the fundamentals of C++ programming, I am utilizing the textbook "Fundamentals of C++ Programming" written by Richard L. Halterman, which serves as an invaluable resource in building a strong foundation in the language.

## Learning Resources

To supplement my learning from the textbook, I have also been exploring video tutorials from two prominent YouTube channels: **The Cherno** and **Caleb Curry**.

1. **The Cherno**: While I acknowledge that this channel may not be the ideal starting point for complete beginners, I find its in-depth explanations and advanced topics particularly enriching as I advance in my C++ understanding.

2. **Caleb Curry**: For those just starting with C++, Caleb Curry's channel offers beginner-friendly content that helps grasp the fundamentals in a clear and approachable manner.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into different branches, each representing a distinct stage of my learning journey. The branches are labeled accordingly for easy identification. I have structured the code files and projects within these branches to align with the chapters and concepts I am studying from the textbook.

## Getting Started

If you wish to explore my progress and code samples, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:Innocentzero0/Road-to-dev.git
   ```
   or for HTTPS
     ```
   git clone https://github.com/Innocentzero0/Road-to-dev.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the specific branch that corresponds to the chapter or topic you are interested in:

   ```
   git checkout master
   ```

4. Use Visual Studio 2019 (or any compatible C++ IDE) to open the project files and code samples.

## Contribution

As I continue my learning journey, I welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from the community. If you notice any errors, offer improvements, or wish to discuss specific C++ concepts, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!
